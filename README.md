### Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

AQTAR takes advantage of **SSR** in Next.js to ensure that content is rendered on the server before being sent to the client. This helps improve the initial page load speed and ensures that search engines can crawl and index the content effectively.

### Client-Side Rendering (CSR)

When the user interacts with the app, **CSR** is used to update the UI dynamically without requiring full page reloads. This provides a smooth, fast user experience.

### Static & Dynamic Content

- Static pages are pre-rendered at build time, improving load times and SEO.
- Dynamic pages, such as product details, are rendered on the server for SEO and performance optimization. This also ensures the app is fast and responsive.

## SEO Optimization

AQTAR is built with **SEO optimization** in mind. Next.js automatically handles SEO for both static and dynamic content:

- **Static Pages**: Pages such as the home page and product listing are pre-rendered, ensuring they are SEO-friendly and indexed by search engines.
- **Dynamic Pages**: Product pages are dynamically generated at runtime using **server-side rendering (SSR)**, ensuring search engines can crawl and index product details even when the content is fetched from an API.

You can further customize the SEO metadata for each page by using the `metadata` object in your Next.js components, ensuring that each page has unique and relevant SEO attributes.
